Deployment Info: 

I made two different schemas one for restaurant data and one for the user data, so both of these schema scripts will need to be ran and are
provided in the directory. 

My json file is sitting in WEB-INF/classes folder as the piazza post told us to do, and this ran properly on my computer.

Here is a video of me using the website and its features: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cXm4zETIsgYowBBBGYu7pQKl97ZADx5B/view?usp=sharing

This was a great project and I feel like I learned a lot :)
